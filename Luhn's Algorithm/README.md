# Credit Card Validation using Luhn's Algorithm

This is a simple guide on how to determine if a credit card number is valid, based on Luhnâ€™s algorithm, which was invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the numberâ€™s second-to-last digit, and then add those productsâ€™ digits together.
2. Add the sum to the sum of the digits that werenâ€™t multiplied by 2.
3. If the totalâ€™s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!

## What I did differently

1. Starting from the rightmost digit, I multiplied every even-indexed digit by 2 and subtracted the result from 9 if it was greater than 9. Then, I added the resulting digits together.
2. I added the sum from step 1 to the sum of the odd-indexed digits.
3. If the total sum ends in a 0 (or, more formally, if the total sum modulo 10 is congruent to 0), then the credit card number is valid according to Luhn's algorithm.

### Example

Let's say we have a credit card number 4003 6000 0000 0014. Here's how we would apply Luhn's algorithm:

1: Starting from the rightmost digit, we multiply every even-indexed digit by 2 and subtract the result from 9 if it's greater than 9:

```markdown
index: 0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15
value: 4 |0 |0 |3 |6 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0  |0  |0  |0  |1  |4
```

* Starting from the rightmost digit, we multiply every even-indexed digit by 2:

```markdown
even-indexed: 14  |12 |10 |8  |6  |4  |2  |0
values:        1  |0  |0  |0  |0  |6  |0  |4

Multiply:     1*2 |0*2|0*2|0*2|0*2|6*2|0*2|4*2
Result:        2  |0  |0  |0  |0  |12 |0  |8
```

* subtract the result from 9 if it's greater than 9:

```markdown
Result:       2| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 0 | 8
greaterThan9:                    -9

Result:  2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 8
Sum1: 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 8 = 13
```

2: I added the sum from step 1 to the sum of the odd-indexed digits.

```markdown
index: 0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15
value: 4 |0 |0 |3 |6 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0  |0  |0  |0  |1  |4
```

```markdown
odd-indexed: 15 |13 |9  |7  |5  |3  |1  
values:      4  |0  |0  |0  |0  |3  |0

Sum1 + Sum2
Sum2: 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 7

sum1 = 13
sum2 = 7

Totalsum: 13 + 7 = 20
```

3: If the total sum ends in a 0 (or, more formally, if the total sum modulo 10 is congruent to 0), then the credit card number is valid according to Luhn's algorithm.

```markdown
Toatalsum = 20 (valid)

or

20 % 10 = 0 (valid)
```

That's it!
